# Team international Stats challenge

## Python Tech Challenge

- The challenge is to create a program that computes some
basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers. You
can assume all values will be less than 1,000.

- Implement this challenge in whatever programming language
best highlights your skills. Also, please supply a README with
details on how to setup and run your application.


## Challenge conditions:

- You cannot import a library that solves it instantly
- The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)
- The method build_stats() can be at most linear O(n)
- Apply the best practices you know
- Share a public repo with your project
